# Tailwind CSS Configuration Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when setting up Tailwind CSS: the CSS styles are not applied to the components.

The problem arises from an incomplete Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js). The `content` array, which specifies the files to scan for Tailwind directives, might be missing or incomplete, thus preventing Tailwind from correctly processing the project's files.

## Bug Description

When running the build process, Tailwind CSS does not generate the expected CSS or applies styles, resulting in components not being styled.

## Solution

To fix this, ensure that your `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` includes all relevant files that contain Tailwind CSS directives. The provided solution demonstrates adding the necessary file paths to the `content` array.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a build process or start a development server.  (specific instructions depend on the tools used in the project, such as Vite, Next.js, etc.)
3. Observe that styles are not applied.
4. Implement the solution provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.
5. Re-run the build process or restart the server. Styles should now be applied.
